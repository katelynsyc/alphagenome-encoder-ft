"""Parsing + scoped-metric utilities for media-5.xlsx's "evolution" category.

Each evolution row's `experiment` column reads like
"evolution: round = 2|2, objective = light|cold-specific, mutations/round = 3|3" --
the sequence was carried through one or more sequential rounds of directed evolution,
each selecting for a specific condition (pipe-separated for multi-stage lineages).

Scoring every evolution row against all 5 Jores conditions (cold/dark/light/warm/maize)
dilutes the signal with conditions nobody actually selected the sequence on. The
functions here recover, per row, which condition(s) its evolution objective(s) actually
targeted, so evaluation can be scoped to just those.
